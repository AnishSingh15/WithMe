## üìù Current Working On
- Rest Timer API implementation (next feature to build)

## üîß Setup Instructions
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/AnishSingh15/WithMe.git
cd WithMe

# Backend setup
cd backend
npm install
# Add .env file with MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, OPENAI_API_KEY, USDA_API_KEY
npm run dev

# Frontend setup (when ready)
cd ../frontend  
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üîë Environment Variables Needed
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fitness-app

```

## üìû AI Assistant Context
This project was built with step-by-step guidance. Key technical decisions:
- Using TypeScript throughout for type safety
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Mongoose with nested schemas for complex workout data
- OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent workout recommendations
- USDA FoodData Central API for comprehensive nutrition data
