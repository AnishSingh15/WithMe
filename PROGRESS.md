## üéØ HOW I'LL TEACH YOU

### My Teaching Method:
1. **Explain the Concept**: What we're building and why
2. **Show the Structure**: How the code is organized
3. **Provide Complete Code**: Full working examples you can copy
4. **Explain Each Line**: What every part does
5. **Connect to Backend**: How it talks to your API
6. **Best Practices**: Why we write code this way

### Your Learning Process:
1. **I'll Explain**: The concept and approach
2. **You'll Type**: The exact code I provide
3. **We'll Test**: Make sure it works
4. **I'll Enhance**: Add more features
5. **You'll Practice**: Modify and experiment

### Example Teaching Style:
```typescript
// I'll give you code like this with detailed comments:

// This interface defines the shape of a User object
// It matches exactly what your backend sends
interface User {
  id: string;           // Unique identifier from MongoDB
  name: string;         // User's display name
  email: string;        // For login authentication
  fitnessGoal: string;  // "muscle_gain", "weight_loss", etc.
}

// I'll explain why we need this interface:
// 1. TypeScript will catch errors if we use wrong property names
// 2. VS Code will give us autocomplete suggestions
// 3. It documents what data we expect from the backend
```

## üîÑ HOW TO RESUME DEVELOPMENT

### When You Switch Laptops:
1. **Clone Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/AnishSingh15/WithMe.git`
2. **Read This Progress File**: Understand where we left off
3. **Tell AI Assistant**: 
   ```
   "I'm continuing my fitness app development. I have a complete backend with authentication, workouts, AI recommendations, and nutrition tracking. Now I need to build the frontend with React/TypeScript/Redux. 
   
   Please check my GitHub repo progress and teach me step by step, starting with TypeScript types. I want to learn by typing the code you provide with detailed explanations."
   ```

### Current Environment Setup:
```bash
# Backend (http://localhost:5002)
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Frontend (http://localhost:3000)  
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables Needed:
```bash
# backend/.env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fitness-app
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
USDA_API_KEY=your-usda-key
```
